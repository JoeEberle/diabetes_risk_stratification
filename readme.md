# 🧠 Importing the PIMA Indians Dataset - Website KAGGLE.COM

The data comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases but is highly curated upon registry to KAGGLE. 

The dataset is for the purposes of predicting whether patients have diabetes based on other variables in the dataset. 

This data is very specific to a sub-population - **IT IS NOT** a representative of a **real world diabetes data set** - it is for learning ONLY. 

## 🧠 The PIMA Indians Data Content 

The observations in the dataset are records of females over 21 years of age with a Pima Indian heritage and variables 
such as: blood pressure, insulin levels, body mass index, etc. 

##  Attributes Normal Value Range
1. **Glucose**: Glucose (< 140) = Normal, Glucose (140-200) = Pre-Diabetic, Glucose (> 200) = Diabetic
2. **BloodPressure**: B.P (< 60) = Below Normal, B.P (60-80) = Normal, B.P (80-90) = Stage 1 Hypertension, B.P (90-120) = Stage 2 Hypertension, B.P (> 120) = Hypertensive Crisis
3. **SkinThickness**: SkinThickness (< 10) = Below Normal, SkinThickness (10-30) = Normal, SkinThickness (> 30) = Above Normal
4. **Insulin** : Insulin (< 200) = Normal, Insulin (> 200) = Above Normal
5. **Body Mass Index**: BMI (< 18.5) = Underweight, BMI (18.5-25) = Normal, BMI (25-30) = Overweight, BMI (> 30) = Obese

## Explanation of Each Model 

1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification that estimates the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class.

2. **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model that splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, making decisions based on feature values to classify instances.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification by finding the 'k' nearest data points in the feature space and assigning the most common class among them to the query point.

4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence among features, often used for text classification tasks.

5. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Similar to Gaussian Naive Bayes but specifically designed for classification tasks with discrete features, such as word counts in text classification.

6. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A supervised learning algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space, often used for binary classification.

7. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

8. **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting library that implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework, known for its speed and performance in handling large datasets.

9. **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**: A type of artificial neural network composed of multiple layers of nodes (neurons) that can learn non-linear relationships between input and output data.

10. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: A machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak learners (typically decision trees) in a sequential manner, with each tree correcting the errors of its predecessors, resulting in a strong predictive model.
